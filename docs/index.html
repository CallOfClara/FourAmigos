### Notes about "African Death Cult" from Jackson Elias to Jonah Kensington

- **Research Efforts:**
    - Elias exhausted all legal channels to unearth information on the Carlyle Expedition in Kenya but found the official responses unsatisfactory.
    
- **Meetings and Site Visits:**
    - Elias organized meetings with leaders from the Kikuyu, Maasi, and Namba tribes.
    - He visited the massacre site, which he described as barren with no signs of life.
    - Local tribesmen attributed the barrenness to a curse by the God of the Black Wind, believed to reside atop a nearby mountain in the Aberdare region/forest.

- **Insights from Johnstone Kenyatta:**
    - Elias reached out to Johnstone Kenyatta, who attributed the massacre to the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.
    - Kenyatta asserted that the cult, led by a high priest, resided in the mountains and worshipped a god alien to Africa.
    - Kenyatta further claimed that traditional tribal magic offered no protection against this cult.
    - Initially skeptical, Elias later acknowledged the potential existence of the Bloody Tongue after further investigation.

- **Further Discoveries:**
    - Elias found accounts of child abductions by winged creatures.
    - He noted the cult’s deity did not match any in the recorded African folklore.
    - Elias questioned various individuals including Sam Mariga, Neville Jermyn, Dr. Starret, Lt. Selkirk, and Cpt. Endicott, gathering diverse perspectives on the mystery.

- **Connections to Carlyle Expedition:**
    - Elias speculated that the expedition had journeyed towards the Nile.
    - He believed the keys to unraveling the Carlyle Expedition’s mysteries were in Egypt and Kenya.

- **Interview with Lt. Mark Selkirk:**
    - Selkirk’s men discovered the massacre site with bodies remarkably preserved, appearing as though torn apart by wild animals.
    - Selkirk could not confirm the presence of any Caucasians during the discovery, challenging some trial statements.

- **Conversation with "Nails" Nelson:**
    - Elias met Nelson at the Victoria Bar in Nairobi, who claimed to have seen Jack Brady (of the Carlyle Expedition) alive in Hong Kong around 1922.
    - This revelation led Elias to suspect that principal members of the Carlyle Expedition might still be alive.

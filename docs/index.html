## Notes about "African death cult" sent from Jackson Elias to Jonah Kensington

- Jackson Elias went through all legal means to gather info about Carlyle Expedition in Kenya but was not satisfied with the response
- Organized a meeting with tribal leaders from Kikuyu, Maasi, and Namba
- Jackson Elias visited massacre site
- Jackson Elias claims massacre site to be barren - nothing is alive there
- Tribesmen who lead him there claim that the site is cursed by the God of the Black Wind whose home is at a nearby mountain top (Aberdare region / forest)
- Jackson Elias contacted Johnstone Kenyatta who claimed that the massacre was carried out by the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. Kenyatta says that the cult operates in the mountain and is lead by a high priest. Kenyatta says that the cults god is not of Africa. Kenyatta claims that tribal magic does not protect against the cult
- Jackson is sceptical about anything said by Johnstone Kenyatta
- Jackson follows up on this info and changes his mind - Thinks Bloody Tongue really exists
- Finds sources that claim that children are being abducted by winged creatures
- Jackson notes that the god of this cult does not appear in documented folklore and does not seem to fit any patterns for African gods
- Jackson questioned, Sam Mariga, Neville Jermyn, Dr. Starret, Lt. Selkirk, Cpt. Endicott
- Jackson thinks Carlyle Expedition moved on the Nile
- Thinks the source of truth for Carlyle Expedition lies in Egypt and Kenya
- Jackson Elias interviewed Lt. Mark Selkirk. Selkirk's men found Carlyle Expedition massacre. Bodies laid in the open but were remarkably undecayed. Torn apart as if by animals but no idea what animals. Selkirk could not confirm whether any Caucasians were part of the team when the site was discovered. Contradicts some statements made during the trial
- Jackson conversed with "Nails" Nelson at the Victoria Bar in Nairobi. Nelson was a mercenary on the Somali-Abyssinian border but escaped to Kenya. Claims he saw Jack Brady (security consultant for Carlyle Expedition) alive in Hong Kong around 1922. Jackson concluded the Carlyle Expedition is probably alive or at least some principal members
